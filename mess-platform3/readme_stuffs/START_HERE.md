## 📖 How to Study Each File

### When Reading Code:

1. **Open the actual file** in your code editor
2. **Read the explanation** from FILE_BY_FILE_EXPLANATION.md
3. **Ask questions**:
   - What does this line do?
   - Why is this here?
   - What happens if I change this?
4. **Trace the flow**: Follow how data moves
5. **Experiment**: Make small changes (in a copy) and see what happens

### Study Technique:

1. **Read** (10 min) - Read the explanation
2. **Code** (20 min) - Look at actual code
3. **Understand** (10 min) - Explain it to yourself
4. **Practice** (20 min) - Try to explain it to someone else (or write it down)
