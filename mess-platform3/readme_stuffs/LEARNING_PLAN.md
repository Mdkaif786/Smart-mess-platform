## 📝 Daily Study Structure

### For Each Day:
1. **Morning (30-45 min)**: Read theory and concepts
2. **Afternoon (30-45 min)**: Go through actual code files
3. **Evening (30-45 min)**: Practice explaining what you learned

### How to Study Each File:
1. **Read the file** - Don't worry if you don't understand everything
2. **Ask questions** - What does this line do? Why is this here?

## 💡 Study Tips

1. **Don't rush** - Better to understand slowly than memorize quickly
2. **Write notes** - Take notes as you learn each concept
3. **Draw diagrams** - Visualize how things connect
4. **Explain out loud** - Pretend you're teaching someone
5. **Break it down** - If something is confusing, break it into smaller parts
6. **Ask questions** - Don't hesitate to ask "why" and "how"

---
